                    As a State Government, Lagos State (LASG) must meet its contractual, statutory, and
                    administrative obligations. We are committed to ensuring that the personal data of our
                    residents and service users is handled in accordance with the data protection regulation.
                    {<br></br>} {<br></br>}        

                    This privacy notice tells you what to expect when LASG collects personal information about
                    you. It applies to all service users. However, the information we will process about you will vary
                    depending on your specific involvement with LASG.
                    {<br></br>} {<br></br>}

                    If we are requesting your personal data, it is because it is necessary and relevant tothe
                    service or function being performed. As such, if you withhold information, it is likely that we will
                    not be able to perform the service or function, or there will be a delay in doing so.
                    {<br></br>} {<br></br>}

                    LASG is the controller for this information unless this notice specifically states otherwise, and its
                    Data Protection Officer can be contacted

                    <div className="title"> 2. Collection of Information </div>

                    The personal data processed by LASG in order to perform its official tasks includes but not limited to:    
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Names, titles, aliases, and photographs</li>
                        
                        <li>Contact details such as telephone numbers, addresses, vehicle registration and
                        email addresses</li>
                        
                        <li>Gender, age, marital status, nationality, education/work history, place of birth, academic/professional qualifications, hobbies, family composition, and dependents</li>

                        <li>Social care records for adults and children in our care</li>

                        <li>Financial identifiers such as bank account numbers, BVN, payment card numbers,
                        payment/transaction identifiers, policy numbers, and claim numbers</li>

                        <li>Residency identifiers such as LASRRA number, National Identification Number (NIN)</li>
                    </ol>  

                    We also process Sensitive Personal Data such as criminal convictions, racial or ethnic origin, mental and physical health records, details of injuries, medication/treatment received, political beliefs, trade union affiliation, genetic data and biometric data.
                    {<br></br>}{<br></br>}

                    These types of data are described in the Nigerian Data Protection Act (NDPA) as “Sensitive data” and require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal data.
                    {<br></br>} {<br></br>}

                    We process sensitive personal data in the following circumstances:

                    <ol>
                        <li>For the provision of social care to children and adults</li>
                        
                        <li>Where it is needed in order to carry out our specific legal obligations.</li>
                        
                        <li>Where it is needed for a matter of substantial public interest (such as in the case of a threat to public health)</li>
                    </ol>  

                    Sometimes we may process this type of personal data in relation to legal claims or to protect your vital interests (or someone else’s vital interests), and you are not capable of giving your consent. This also applies where you have already made the information public.

                    <div className="title"> 4. Information Sharing </div>

                    We use a number of 3rd party consultants, vendors and partners to either store personal information or to manage it on our behalf, and also to provide certain services to you. Where we have these arrangements there is always a contract, memorandum of understanding or information sharing protocol in place to ensure that the organization complies with data protection regulation.
                    {<br></br>}{<br></br>}

                    We may also need to share data internally between ministries, departments and agencies where this is legal and proportionate.
                    {<br></br>}{<br></br>}
                    
                    In addition, there are circumstances when we are likely to share data with other public authorities and organizations where there is a legal basis for doing so, which might include but not limited to:
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Local Governments</li>
                        
                        <li>Federal Government</li>
                        
                        <li>Health service providers/regulator</li>

                        <li>The Police</li>

                        <li>FRSC</li>

                        <li>Housing associations</li>

                        <li>Voluntary and charity organizations</li>
                    </ol>  

                    Sometimes we have a legal duty to supply information about people. This is often because we must give that information to courts, including:

                    <ol>
                        <li>When we take a child into care;</li>
                        
                        <li>Court orders; and</li>
                        
                        <li>Cases under health emergencies.</li>
                    </ol>

                    In very limited circumstances we may share your personal information when there is a pressing and legal reason for doing so that is more important than protecting your confidentiality, for example, if there a serious risk to an individual’s safety. Wemay share your information:

                    <ol>
                        <li>For the detection and prevention of crime/fraudulent activity; or</li>
                        
                        <li>If there are serious risks to the public, our staff or to other professionals;</li>
                        
                        <li>To protect a child; or</li>

                        <li>To protect adults who are thought to be at risk, for example if they are frail, confused or
                        cannot understand what is happening to them.</li>
                    </ol>

                    This risk must be identified as being serious before we can go against your right to privacy. When we are worried about your physical safety or we feel that we need to take action to protect you or another person from being harmed in other ways, we will discuss this with you and, if possible, get your permission to tell others about your situation.
                    {<br></br>}{<br></br>}

                    When using personal data for research purposes, the data will be anonymized to avoid the identification of an individual, unless consent has been given for the use of the personal data. 
                    {<br></br>}{<br></br>}
                    
                    We do not sell or provide personal information to any other organization for the purposes of direct marketing. 
                    {<br></br>}{<br></br>}
                    
                    We will seek your consent where we need to send your Personal Data to a country without an adequate data protection law.

                    LASG will only retain and store your data for as long as it is needed for the purpose for which it was collected, or as required by the law, or as dictated by best practice as stipulated by our retention policy. We will keep some records permanently if we are legally required to do so. We may keep some other records for an extended period of time. For example, it is currently best practice to keep financial records for a minimum period of 8 years to support audits or provide tax information. We may have legal obligations to retain some data in connection with our statutory obligations as a public authority. We will endeavor to keep data only for as long as we need it, and this means that we will delete it when it is no longer needed
