        text : `<p>• State’s GDP rises to N41 trillion in five years, says Trade Commissioner</p>
<p>• Third Africa Social Impact Summit holds in Lagos</p>
<p>A new push for an aggressive investment inflow to boost Lagos State’s economic growth was, on Wednesday, led by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at a Pre-Summit Investor Roundtable held in the State.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sanwo-Olu and his team in the State Executive Council reeled out new investment focus and areas of opportunities before potential investors at the third edition of Africa Social Impact Summit (ASIS 3.0) organised by Sterling One Foundation in collaboration with Ministry of Commerce, Cooperatives, Trade and Investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event with the theme: “Invest Lagos – Investment Opportunities” was held at Eko Hotels and Suites in Victoria Island, with business leaders, multilateral chambers of commerce, financial services executives and captains of industry in attendance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lagos, the Governor told the forum, is projecting a positive economic outlook, given its expanding population and development of sustainable infrastructure to drive growth.</p>
<p>In spite of the challenging terrain in which many businesses operate, Sanwo-Olu said the State’s economy had demonstrated remarkable resilience to sustain existing businesses and welcome new investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Governor emphasised that the key reforms introduced and implemented by his administration were aimed at streamlining business development processes and building investors’ confidence in the State’s economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sanwo-Olu said his Government had been proactive in implementing business-friendly regulations and constantly reviewing Ease of Doing Business policies to lessen challenges associated with new business registration and obtaining permits. He said the digitisation of services had eliminated bureaucratic bottlenecks, while enhancing stability in the business environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said: “For us in Lagos, we have sustained a consistent growth in our investment profile. The minimum we can do is to take the growth another level and ensure that the gains of the past years are not reversed. In the last five years, Lagos GDP has grown by 50 per cent despite the difficult economic conditions Lagos has faced. Our economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This new conversation with the investment community is necessary in order to de-risking issues, while providing enabling environment and assurance to address what could be investors’ major concern in committing their investments here. Whatever the size of the investment injected into Lagos, we will play our own role as a State Government to ensure that these efforts are guaranteed of returns and security.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sanwo-Olu highlighted areas of opportunities to invest, including transportation, tourism, health insurance and waterways, noting that the State Government remained committed to pushing forward its ambitious development plans for the listed sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner for Commerce, Cooperatives, Trade and Investment, Mrs. Folashade Ambrose-Medebem, said Lagos, as the nation’s commercial nerve center, had been a beacon of economic activity driven by commitment to fostering conducive environment for business and investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commissioner said the Sanwo-Olu administration had grown Lagos GDP from 27 trillion to 41 trillion within five years, stressing that the State had made progress in creating a business-friendly environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The State Government, she said, implemented key reforms aimed at streamlining processes, improving regulatory procedures, reducing bureaucratic bottlenecks and promoting entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said: “Lagos had made significant strides in diversifying its economy with strategic investments in various sectors, including allocating N550.7 billion to expand sustainable physical infrastructure in 2024 alone. We have consistently focused on boosting agriculture as a cornerstone of our economic diversification strategy, committing N44.33 billion to food security initiatives in cattle feedlot project, fish processing, and wholesale produce hub in communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Lagos continues to lead in promoting Ease of Doing Business, which has positioned the State as a global city and an emerging African Financial Centre. Under the World Bank’s Subnational Doing Business Report and the State Action on Business Enabling Reforms (SABER) programme, Lagos has met all parameters and qualified for the first phase of the initiative. The State is committed to further reforms that increase transparency of official fees, improve investment promotion environments, and enhance land administration processes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing Director of Sterling Bank, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, said economic growth in Africa suffered setbacks because of unstable investment climate occasioned by lack of trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said the objective of the summit meeting was to build confidence of investors in the local markets and create a business environment that would enhance trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lagos, he said, remained the leading destination for investors because of the State’s strategic roadmap for its economic growth. He noted Lagos had continued to provide clarity in creating access to markets for investors, while also maintaining consistency in communicating its investment decisions.</p>`,

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sequel to the routine maintenance works on pedestrian and vehicular Bridges in the State, the Lagos State Government has issued a travel directory for the duration of the maintenance works on the Odo Iya Alaro Bridge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Alternately, motorists from Berger, Magodo, and Tollgate along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway are advised to go through the Alapere/Ogudu axis inward Gbagada/Anthony Oke Bridge to descend the ramp and access Ikorodu Road to continue their journeys. Also Motorists coming from Ikeja, Oregun, and Kudirat Abiola Way are advised to use the Opebi Link Bridge to connect Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way inwards Sheraton through Maryland to access Ikorodu Road and navigate their ways”.</p>

        img : 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GTUDP6jXAAAqAFf?format=jpg&name=large',
        text : `<p>Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has disclosed the plans to deploy 2,000 high-capacity buses through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for mass public transportation next year.</p>
<p>Governor Sanwo-Olu made the revelation at the Lagos Investment Roundtable organised by the State Ministry of Commerce, Cooperatives, Trade &amp; Investment (MCCTI), as a Pre-event to the African Social Impact Summit (ASIS)&nbsp; in Lagos on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to the Governor, the buses will run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), along with 5,000 new cars to be provided as taxis through a partnership with a car manufacturer, in line with the climate-compliant smart city initiative of the State.</p>
<p>His words: “Our administration has devoted considerable resources to critical infrastructure across transportation, health, agriculture, road and others, but our doors are not closed yet to interested investors to partner with the State”.</p>
<p>For instance, we noted that about 90 per cent of transportation in the State is still done through roads. This should not be the best way, so there is a need to explore the waterways and other alternatives. On waterways, we have established a full Command and Control Centre, with full monitoring capability to ensure safety and timely rescue intervention while we have secured a $400 million World Bank facility to expand that mode of transportation.</p>
<p>“We have also devoted huge resources to rail, but it is not just about what we have done; it is the fact that there are huge opportunities for additional investments, and our prospective investors can adopt the State’s model for exploring the other rail routes in the State”.</p>
<p>Mr. Governor remarked that the ongoing Omu Creek road and bridge works will be a game-changing project as it will unlock huge potentials of the Omu axis, in addition to other ongoing projects such as Opebi-Ojota link bridge and road works in Ikeja, Abiola Onijemo bridge and road works in Ifako-Ijaiye, Obafemi Dada Street in Alimosho and others as they connect three to four road network within their located areas.</p>
<p>“Our Food Hub is a model in Africa for food security and the State’s ability to feed its people. Through storage, the State will also be able to stabilise food prices as we plan to partner with other states by serving as off-takers for their farm produce while we connect the large Food Hub to the middle-level market for the supply of fresh food items”, he said.</p>
<p>Sanwo-Olu also highlighted the remarkable impact of his administration in innovation, health, climate change and resilience, tourism and housing and a whole lot of investment opportunities available in the sectors.</p>
<p>In calling for more investments, he said Lagos is a place we all need to preserve and doing otherwise will be severe for us.</p>
<p>“It is about the legacies we are leaving behind and how we want to be remembered as we all work to ensure that Lagos remains a livable city. It is that Investment we commit today that builds the city and the society we live in”.</p>
<p>Commissioner for Commerce, Cooperatives, Trade &amp; Investment, Mrs. Folashade Ambrose-Medebem, remarked that Lagos State has firmly established itself as Nigeria’s economic epicentre and a leading hub of innovation in Africa, with its vibrant and diverse economy, driven by sectors such as technology, entertainment, finance, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>“With over 500 startups and despite facing challenges like currency fluctuations and economic uncertainties, Lagos has demonstrated remarkable resilience. The State government remains committed to infrastructure development and economic stability through significant investment in transportation, such as the Blue and Red Rail Lines, which have improved connectivity and reduced logistics costs, enhancing productivity and economic activities.</p>
<p>“As we reflect on the discussions and insights shared at the Lagos Investment Roundtable, it is clear that Lagos State stands at a pivotal juncture in its economic journey. With its strategic geographic location, vibrant population of approximately 22.5 million, and a growing GDP that has recently reached N41 trillion and more, Lagos is poised to continue its trajectory as a leading economic powerhouse in Nigeria and across the African continent”, she said.</p>
<p>Managing Director, Sterling Bank Plc, Abubakar Sulaiman commended Sanwo-Olu’s administration for recording giant strides across all facets of development. “One of the things that stand Lagos out is that the State communicates and engages stakeholders using multiple platforms. This is highly responsible of the government”, he said.</p>`,
