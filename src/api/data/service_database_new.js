                            <p>The Lagos Waste Management Authority(LAWMA), formerly known as Lagos State Refuse Disposal Board (LSRDB) at inception was established in 1977 vide Edict No. 9 of 1977 when it was glaring during Nigeria’s preparation for Festival of Arts and Culture (Festac ’77) that the then two Local Government Councils, namely Lagos Island and Lagos Mainland, could not cope with the volume of waste resulting from the oil- boom stimulated economy and its attendant influence on migrants into the new capital city from the rural and less developed areas of Nigeria and neighbouring West African countries.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong>Authority (LAWMA)</strong></p>
                            <p>In December 1991, the name Lagos State Waste Management Authority was christened vide Edict No 55 which made the agency to be responsible for the collection, transportation and disposal of municipal and industrial waste as well as the provision of commercial waste services to the state and Local Government Councils.</p>
                            <p>The Authority was renamed Lagos Waste Management Authority in March 2007 vide LAWMA Law No. 5 cap. 27, Vol. 40 of 2007.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong>Restructuring into a Regulatory Agency</strong></p>
                            <p>By provision of Environmental Management &amp; Protection Law of 1st March, 2017 the Authority is re-positioned from an Operator/Regulator into a full Regulator in the Waste Management Sector, in line with Cleaner Lagos initiative. By this arrangement, public waste operations, Domestic Waste Operations, Waste Management Operations, Landfill</p>
                            <p>Operations and Transfer Loading stations have been concessioned to private sector participants, while LAWMA will guide, model and appraise these practitioners in line with international best practices.</p>

                            <p>The amount of waste generation in Lagos State continues to increase along with rapid increase in population, accelerated urbanization, industrialization pace, economic growth, business activities and consumption patterns; all these directly and indirectly drive up solid waste quantities from households, commercial institutions, industrial concerns and market outlets. In a bid to achieve a cleaner and livable Lagos, the Authority has continued to plan and implement programs and activities, not only to meet the ever expanding challenges, but also to prepare for future challenges.</p>
                            <p>The Authority has continued to consolidate on efforts made on environmental sustainability, adopting the following strategies in meeting the waste management needs of residents in the state:</p>

                            <p>Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), in ensuring that waste sorting and recycling message is taken to every nook and cranny of the state, began the distribution of bins at markets, malls, schools and other public spaces for segregation of recyclables, in line with the Lagos Recycle Initiative.</p>
                            <p>The placement of the bins, strictly designed for collection of recyclable items like PET bottles, aluminum, cans and other plastic waste, was meant to sensitize and encourage residents to imbibe the culture of waste segregation at points of generation.</p>`

                            <p>The need for State Information Communication Technology is very germane to the growth and development of a State. This was the foresight of the Government then that gave birth to Lagos State Residents’ Registration Agency (LASRRA), when the bill was passed into law on 27 June 2011 (Law No 21), it was formally launched and registration was flagged off on the 19th&nbsp;September 2013 by the former Governor, His Excellency, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola.nn</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The Lagos State Residents’ Registration Agency (LASRRA) is the Agency of Government responsible for the creation of a reliable database of all Residents in Lagos State to assist the State Government in deploying resources for the overall development and growth of the State. LASRRA’s strategic plan is to provide a unique means of identification for access to State services and facilities while also providing a centralized database to all MDAs of Lagos State for planning purposes.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>LASRRA, an autonomous and strategic Agency of Government, saddled with the primary responsibility to create an accurate database of all Lagos residents for effective planning and resource allocation.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Building a greater and smarter Lagos in line with the six pillars of development (T.H.E.M.E.S), LASRRA 2.0. was introduced.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>LASRRA 2.0 is a continuation of the registration of residents utilizing new applications and technologies to drive seamless and real-time registration processes for residents in the State.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The outcome of the registration process is to generate a&nbsp;Unique Identification Number&nbsp;(UID) and to issue a Lagos State Resident ‘Smart’ identity card for each resident of the State.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The Smart Card provides a unified data ecosystem for ease of access to all services across the various MDAs in the State.</p>`

                        <p>Since the inception of the current administration in Lagos State, several attempts have been made to improve the Health Care Services Delivery System in the State. These attempts had culminated in the introduction of the Health Reform Agenda which is backed by Law. The main aim of this reform agenda is to improve the quality of health care delivery in the State.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A vital component of this process is the regulation of the private sector, a major provider of healthcare services to over 60% of the population. Hence, the establishment of a number of regulatory and monitoring agencies which included the Health Facilities Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The HEFAMAA was established in March 2006 and is charged with the responsibility of monitoring both private and public health facilities to ensure registration and in the near future, accreditation of all health facilities in Lagos State.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>With the recent launch of the Lagos State Health Scheme, HEFAMAA has been given the responsibility of providing facilities that will be empaneled on the scheme by Lagos State Health Management Agency using some strict eligibility criteria.</p>

                        <p>Since the inception of the current administration in Lagos State, several attempts have been made to improve the Health Care Services Delivery System in the State. These attempts had culminated in the introduction of the Health Reform Agenda which is backed by Law. The main aim of this reform agenda is to improve the quality of health care delivery in the State.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>A vital component of this process is the regulation of the private sector, a major provider of healthcare services to over 60% of the population. Hence, the establishment of a number of regulatory and monitoring agencies which included the Health Facilities Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The HEFAMAA was established in March 2006 and is charged with the responsibility of monitoring both private and public health facilities to ensure registration and in the near future, accreditation of all health facilities in Lagos State.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>With the recent launch of the Lagos State Health Scheme, HEFAMAA has been given the responsibility of providing facilities that will be empaneled on the scheme by Lagos State Health Management Agency using some strict eligibility criteria.</p>

                        <p>In the quest and vision of the current Governor of Lagos State , Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu in making Lagos a 21st Century economy, the Office of the Special Adviser on Housing had the mandate responsibilities to oversee the erstwhile Lagos State Real Estate Transaction Department in the Ministry of Housing as established by Law on the 18th of May, 2007. The Law was expedient due to reported/ increasing cases of fraud in the Real Estate Sector. However, after careful examination of the extant laws and engagements with relevant Stakeholders within the public and private space , Mr Governor unveiled the intention of his Administration to put an end to fraudulent and unscrupulous practices in the real estate sector.</p>
                        <p>In a memo Ref. No: CIR/HOS/'20/Vol.1/027 dated the 7th February 2020 Mr. Governor approved the transition of Lagos State Real Estate Transaction Department (LASRETRAD) from a Department to a full Agency now known as Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority(LASRERA).</p>
                        <p>The Lagos State Estate Agency Regulatory Law, Cap L28, Laws of Lagos State, 2015 ("Law") presently in operation in the State, provides for the establishment of the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority. The essence of this Law is to regulate real estate transactions in Lagos State by identifying persons eligible to be licensed as Real Estate Practitioners and provides for the issuance or renewal of annual permits, as well as collating and registering Real Estate transactions in the State.Specifically, the Authority has the responsibility for maintaining a register of Licensed Real Estate Practitioners and sanctioning of unlicensed Estate Agents in the State.In its bid to sanitize and promote transparency, the State must keep a database of persons dealing in Real Estate transactions, regulate and monitor the activities of all Practitioners. Thus, the State must ensure strict compliance and adherence to the law in its efforts to protect its citizens and rid the State of unethical practices in the Sector.</p>`

               short : `<p><strong>Brief History of Lagos Television</strong></p>
                            <p>In October 1980, the administration of Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande established its own Television Station to oil its information dissemination machinery on November 9, 1980, Lagos Television commenced transmission on a Very High Frequency (VHF) Channel 5.</p>
                            <p>The formal review of the Nigerian Communication Laws as well as the return of military rule in 1983 engendered a new dawn in broadcasting as there was a firm directive that all Television stations, apart from NTA be restricted to the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band. In compliance, Lagos Television moved to UHF Channel 35.</p>
                            <p>Lagos Television was the first TV station in Nigeria to operate on two frequencies – VHF and UHF simultaneously. This explains the Station’s former payoff; The Power of Television x2. Apart from being the first Television Station outside the NTA family, the Station took the Nigerian Television industry by storm in the early 80s with the introduction of a 60- hour non-stop weekend transmission from 7pm on Friday till 7am on Mondays. The then Lagos Weekend Television was the first marathon Television station in Africa. It’s unprecedented public approval transformed TV viewership especially with the Lagos precinct and brought a change in the call sign to LTV/LWT.</p>
                            <p>During those years, the operations of Lagos Television were not without its challenges. In September, 1985, a mysterious midnight inferno consumed the entire legacy of the station. It destroyed the studios, the library, offices and equipment even official records; personal effects of the staff were not spared.</p>
                            <p>For about one and half year, Lagos Television remained in the doldrums merely surviving but in 1995 Col. Buba Marwa, the then sole administrator of the State set up a re-organization committee to assess the position of the Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation (LSBC) and determine her need to survive.</p>
                            <p>In 1998, the administration of the former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu saw the need to implement the recommendation of the committee set up to look into the re-organization of the Lagos State Broadcasting Corporation (LSBC) (Lagos Television and Radio Services under the management) and this led to the split of the two organizations for effective management, better performance, autonomy and to create career prospect for members of staff.</p>
                            <p>Thereafter, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu called for a blue print on the re- engineering and re-positioning of Lagos Television. Satisfied with what was presented and undaunted by the enormity of the capital outlay, in the midst of competing demands, he took the bull by the horn and gave a fresh breadth of life to the Station. Impact</p>
                            <p>In June 2008, Lagos Television scored another first when it became the first and the only state-owned Television Station on DSTV Channel 129 and the formal switch-over ceremony was performed by the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN). The Channel was later changed to 256.</p>
                            <p>The Station did not stop there because of the introduction of various “Direct to Homes (DHT) platforms” she also secured platforms on Startimes channel 113, GOTV Channel 90, Play TV Channel 950; which increased the Station’s visibility beyond the shores of Nigeria. The live streaming facility (on TV now and Lagos Television apps) was another plus.</p>
                            <p>In the area of extra broadcasting activities, LTV has carved a niche as a truly people-oriented TV station with the annual Lagos Television Christmas Fair and the ultra-modern event facilities nicknamed De-Blue Roof and Combo Hall.</p>`

With the creation of Lagos State, the Governor's Office was established and an official working unit was created to assist the Military Administrator in the discharge of his duties. This team comprised the Military Administrator in the person of Major Mobolaji Johnson and four officers namely: Mr. A. E. Howson-Wright, then Permanent Secretary of Internal Affairs and chairman of the Caretaker Committee for the City of Lagos, Mr. F.C.O. Coker, a brilliant economist and Chartered Accountant, Mr. I. O. Agoro, a Legal Officer seconed from the Federal Ministry of Justice and Mr. J. O. Adeyemi-Bero, an Administrative Officer who was the Secretary of the working unit. Since the creation of the Lagos State Governor's Office, it has undergone series of transformation in structure and nomenclature for effective and efficient administration of the State Government. It was once referred to as Political and General Administration Department, Military Governor's Office, until June 1999 when it was change to the Office of the Chief of Staff (Governor's Office).</p>`

                        <p>Lagos Ferry Services Company (LFSC) (also known as LAGFERRY) is the major ferry services provider in Lagos State. Although Lagos ferry services commenced operations in 1925, passenger ferries gradually intensified until the 1970s which led to the establishment of Lagferry in 1983. The former Lagos State Ferry Services Corporation as at jakande’s administration was wound-down as an agency of the Government due to lack of evidence of its legal incorporation. The entity was responsible for both the regulatory and operational aspects of water transportation. The next step was then to create a new regulatory Agency for the management of the water ways with a mandate that includes the business of water transportation. The Lagos STtae Waterways (LASWA) was established in 2008 and is responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance of operators to the former Gov. Babatunde Raji Fashola’s administration policy, in addition to being a resource hub for all manners of marine related matters. This provides the appropriate enabling environment for potential operators to implement their business strategies and capitalize on the vast number of commuters seeking alternate transport in Lagos.</p>`

                            <p>As with the Federal scheme, the State schemes were also fraught with problems such as lack of adequate funding, irregular pension payments and the rigorous exercise of verification of pensioners. In line with modern global changes, the Federal Government on 27th June 2004 changed from the Defined Benefit scheme to the Contributory Pension Scheme with the signing into law of the Pension Reform Act 2004 which set up the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) to regulate and supervise the scheme and register the operators of the scheme.</p>

                            <p>To assist all persons in the employment of the State Government to save towards their retirement.</p>
                            <p>To ensure that persons who leave or retire from the Public Service of the State receive their terminal or retirement benefits as and when due.</p>
                            <p>To establish a set of rules and regulations for the administration and payment of retirement benefits in the Public Service of the State.</p>
                            <p>The law also established the group life policy for death benefits of employees, whilst in service, as well as the Retirement Bond for employees with past service benefits and the Redemption Fund from which the liability of the bond payment would be made.</p>`

Babatunde Raji Fashola’s administration policy, in addition to being a resource hub for all manners of marine related matters. This provides the appropriate enabling environment for potential operators to implement their business strategies and capitalize on the vast number of commuters seeking alternate transport in Lagos.</p>`
